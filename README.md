# basic-form-practice

In this basic practice challenge, we'll be using a form to update our DOM.

Fork and clone down this repo to get started. You'll be writing all of your code in the `index.js` file. It's already connected to your `index.html` file. You won't need to run `json-server` or make any fetch requests in this basic practice.

### Basic Form Practice

We currently have a form that allows users to create a new note for themselves. When a user submits a new note, we want their note to be displayed in a new `li` within the `ul` that has the id `note-list`.

### Practicing Parse-Int

We have another form that allows users to update the value
of a win record for a sport. We want to use the form to update
the value of the number displayed in our paragraph displaying the win record. We DO still want to display the text "Win Record:" along with the new win-record number.



That's all! There are no tests for this lab - you just need to make sure it's working correctly.
